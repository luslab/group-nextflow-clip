# CLIP nextflow analysis pipeline

![logo](https://github.com/luslab/group-nextflow-clip/blob/dev/images/clip_1.jpg)

## Info

The original CLIP method was first [published](CLIP%20Identifies%20Nova-Regulated%20RNA%20Networks%20in%20the%20Brain) in 2003. 

Two useful papers about the experimental and computational methods are:

- [Advances in CLIP Technologies for Studies of Protein-RNA Interactions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.01.005)
- [Data Science Issues in Studying Proteinâ€“RNA Interactions with CLIP Technologies](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-080917-013525)

There are a number of public data resources available:

 1. iCLIP in a range of cells and tissues by the Ule lab on [iMaps](https://imaps.genialis.com/)
 2. eCLIP in K562 and HepG2 cell lines by [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/matrix/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_slims=RNA%20binding&award.project=ENCODE&assay_title=eCLIP&biosample_ontology.classification=cell%20line).

## Development

To collaborate on this pipeline please follow the contribution guidelines written below. These documents will evolve over time so please keep checking regulary.

There is a set process to follow for submitting code, so that the codebase is always clear, robust and well tested.

### Software

You will need the following software and tools installed on your dev machine to contribute to this project:

- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) (Create a docker hub account and create an issue assigned to me to add you to the luslab group)
- Download a GUI for git, I use [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- A code editor such as [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Setup

Add extensions to VS code
Log into luslab on docker
