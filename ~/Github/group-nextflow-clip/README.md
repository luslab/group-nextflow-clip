## Info

Two useful papers about the experimental and computational methods are:

- [Advances in CLIP Technologies for Studies of Protein-RNA Interactions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.01.005)
- [Data Science Issues in Studying Proteinâ€“RNA Interactions with CLIP Technologies](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-080917-013525)

## Development

To collaborate on this pipeline please follow the contribution guidelines written below. These documents will evolve over time so please keep checking regulary.

There is a set process to follow for submitting code, so that the codebase is always clear, robust and well tested.
